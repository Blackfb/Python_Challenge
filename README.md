* In this Project, I created  a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company.

* Created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  
  * Also, final script both print the analysis to the terminal and exporting a text file with the results.

* Final analysis:
